# Document Classification using NLP, Machine Learning
## Objective
Performed document classification into four defined categories (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech). Trained the classifier accuracy with different models ranging from Na√Øve Bayes to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). By making use of different feature engineering techniques and Natural Language Processing (NLP) features created an accurate text classifier.


## Tech Stack
- Language- Python
- Libraries- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit Learn, NLTK, Keras, TensorFlow backend
- Models- Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Shallow Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network.

## Implementation
