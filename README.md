Performed document classification into four defined categories (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech). Compare the classifier accuracy with different models ranging from Na√Øve Bayes to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). By making use of different feature engineering techniques and extra NLP features create an accurate text classifier.
